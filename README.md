# Realtime-communication with WEBRTC 
pre-project for SW-Jungle Project.

## Overview

The app to get video and take snapshots with client's webcam and share them peer-to-peer via WebRTC

## Signaling

 mechanism to coordinate communication and to send control messages, a process known as signaling.

 In this repository I will use Socket.IO for messaging, but there are many [alternatives](https://github.com/muaz-khan/WebRTC-Experiment/blob/master/Signaling.md).


## todo

- Get video from your webcam
- Stream video with RTCPeerConnection
- Stream data with RTCDataChannel
- Set up a signaling service to exchange messages
- Combine peer connection and signaling
- Take a photo and share it via a data channel
